// Question for TA or Tutor - why do I need to use /api for getting the data -- and why does it not like it 
// when I try to serve my HTML page from the same place the data is being called. Does it have something to do
// with the following line of code? Just kind of want to get an idea of best practices in organizing what routes where
// Is it confusing to the sevrer if I have /notes serving both data and a static page
// The front-end fetch has api in the path and just kind of need  a refresher on how that's talking to each other
// Cant Insomia hit the endpoint where the data is on it's own?
